## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 📁 Files Included

- `schematic/` – Circuit diagrams of the development board  
- `PCB/` – PCB layout and design files  
- `README.md` – You're reading it!

### 🔌 Required Tools

- **Proteus** (for simulation)
- **Keil µVision** or **MIDE-51** (for programming)
- **8051 Programmer** (e.g., USBASP or equivalent with 8051 support)

### ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0xSafkat20/Intel8051-DevBoard.git
   ```
2. Open the schematic or PCB files with Proteus or your preferred EDA tool.

3. Program the 8051 with your own code using Keil/MIDE and a compatible programmer.

4. Connect peripherals or modules via header pins and start experimenting!
